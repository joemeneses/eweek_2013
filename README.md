This application requires Python 2.7 installed and makes use of th Tkinter GUI library.

This application was written for Engineering Week 2013 (Feb 17-23, 2013) for a join event between
	East Los Angeles COllege Computer Science and Engineering Club (CSE)
		and the
	East Los Angeles COllege Robotics CLub

The Event allowed users without previous programming experience to use this GUI to easily program a Sumo-Bot to navigate through a maze by committing commands to a queue and uploaded to the robot using Parallax BASIC Stamp Editor 2.5.3
